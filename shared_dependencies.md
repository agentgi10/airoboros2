1. **Python Libraries**: All the Python files will share common Python libraries such as selenium, json, and os.

2. **Chromedriver**: The "chromedriver.exe" is a shared dependency for "main.py" and "scraper.py" as it is required to automate the browser for web scraping.

3. **Configurations**: The "config.py" file will contain shared configurations like the base URL, pagination parameters, and other constants. These configurations will be used by "main.py", "scraper.py", and "data_handler.py".

4. **Data Schema**: The data schema for the scraped data will be shared between "scraper.py" and "data_handler.py". The schema will define the structure of the data to be stored in "output.jsonl".

5. **Utility Functions**: The "utils.py" file will contain utility functions that can be used across all other Python files. These might include helper functions for handling exceptions, formatting data, etc.

6. **DOM Element IDs**: The "scraper.py" will use the IDs of the DOM elements to extract data from the webpage. These IDs will also be used in "main.py" to initiate the scraping process.

7. **Output File**: The "output.jsonl" file is a shared resource between "main.py" and "data_handler.py". The "main.py" initiates the data writing process and "data_handler.py" writes the scraped data into this file.

8. **Function Names**: Function names like `scrape_data()`, `handle_pagination()`, `write_to_file()` etc. will be shared across "main.py", "scraper.py", and "data_handler.py" as these functions will be called in multiple places.

9. **Message Names**: Message names for logging and error handling will be shared across all Python files. These might include messages for successful scraping, error messages, etc.
